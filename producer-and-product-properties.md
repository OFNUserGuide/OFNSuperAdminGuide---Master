To set up, go to

&gt;=&gt; \*Products / Properties\*

BE CAREFUL: on the product page, when you add properties to a product through your super-admin account, you are not proposed the existing list of properties, you have to start typing for a suggestion to appear, and you are not blocked if you write a new property, which will be added to the whole properties list... so there is a high risk of creating duplicates, that then will be proposed in the general list and generate confusion! So the easiest way to avoid mistakes is to always use a regular "user account" when working on tasks related to hubs and products administration. Don't add products when using your super-admin account ;-\)
