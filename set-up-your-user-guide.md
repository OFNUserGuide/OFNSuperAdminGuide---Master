# Create a user guide to support your users

The OFN community use Gitbook to host their user guides. You can choose some other tool if you prefer, but to make your life easier, we propose you a tutorial on how to set up a user guide using Gitbook.



## 1- Create an organization on Gitbook

The first step is to create an organization on https://www.gitbook.com/.  
This organization can host for free 5 members. So you can have up to 5 people able to edit the user guide from https://www.gitbook.com/ which has a pretty user friendly interface.  
If you want to enable more people to contribute in the user guide, you will need to synchronize with Github, and invite people in the associated Github repository.  The interface there is a bit less user friendly, but it does the job ;-\)  
Also you will have to create that Github synchronization if you want to be able to copy the content of the original OFN user guide to adapt it.

## 2- Synchronize with Github

### a- Create a Github repository 

Go on https://github.com/ and create yourself an account if you don't have one yet.Then click on "New organization"

If you want to invite other members to that Github organization you can add them already, but you can also do that later.

Then you are invited to create a repository. Do it!
