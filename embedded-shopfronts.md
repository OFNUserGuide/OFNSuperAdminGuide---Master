# Embedded Shopfronts and Groups

This feature lets users who have OFN shopfronts embed their shop into their own website. This gives customers a more fluid experience and avoids the need to redirect them between multiple websites. It also allows users to retain some of their visual branding in the shop. When you embed your OFN shop in your own site, your OFN based shop will remain, so customers can choose where they want to shop. [The User Guide for enterprises using embedded shopfronts is here](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbooks.io/ofn-user-guide-master/content/embedded-shopfronts.html). This page explains what to do when contacted by an enterprise wanting to set up an embedded shop.
