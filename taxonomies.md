# Taxonomies

These are the 'product categories' that products are sorted into \(e.g. Meat, vegetables, dairy\). You need to have product categories set-up before you can start creating products, as every Product must have a product category.

_&gt;&gt; Note that once you create a taxonomy and there are products assigned to it you cannot delete the taxonomy. Therefore put some thought into the taxonomies before you launch._

Any taxonomies, and entries within them, that you create will become available as Product Categories to attach to products. We HIGHLY recommend that you keep them high-level \(E.g. 'Vegetables', not 'root vegetables', 'summer vegetables', 'leafy greens'\) . . these product categories will become the filters at the top of your list views and shop-front and you do not want too many in use across your site

You can attach icons to product categories. Just not here \(Myriam do you know where this would be done?\)

Below are the settings from the Australian instance as an example to work from.![](/assets/Taxonomies)

Once setup, your view of the taxonomies page will be something like below.
