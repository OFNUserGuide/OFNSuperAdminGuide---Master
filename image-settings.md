## Image Settings

Make a decision whether to use Amazon S3 or some other storage for your images. Not using S3 can be problematic as a big user might create disk shortage errors and hence server failures. Then you need to buy more HDD on the hosting server which would be more expensive than s3. I would think it would be better \(and best practice\) to use an external server for images and s3 is cheap and already configured.
