# All you need to configure when you set up an OFN instance

Congratulation! You have deployed the OFN code base on a server and are ready to start playing with it :-\)

This User Guide is for people who are setting up, hosting and managing their own instance of the Open Food Network. Once installed and running, we refer to you as Super-Admin.

There are a couple of things you need to configure to get all the power out of this piece of code:

* [Configuration Basics](/chapter1.md)
* Countries and states  
* Taxonomies  
* Taxes and Tax Zones  
* Formats for numbers  
* Invoice format  
* Stripe \(if you want to enable Stripe payments\)

Also for your website to work in your local language you will need to set you up an account on Transifex and translate all the content.

You can also create your own localized version of the OFN Gitbook user guide.

This guide book takes you step by step on your journey to set up you OFN instance as a super-admin. We won't talk about developers / system administration stuff here, for that please see our [github wiki](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki).
