# Analytics Trackers

{% hint style="info" %}
This setup is only for Google Analytics. If you want to use Matomo, some admin of our Matomo service needs to add your domain to it. Please ask other instance managers on Slack !
{% endhint %}

This is where you can apply google analytics to an instance. You need to create an account on Google Analytics first, and then link the ID within this configuration page.

Below is an example of an analytics tracker setup.

Note that currently there is no capacity to offer individual shops their own analytics tracker. The instance will gather all analytics data.
