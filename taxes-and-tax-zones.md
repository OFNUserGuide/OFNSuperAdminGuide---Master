NB. My basic starting setup for Germany is

Create new zone Germany and make it default tax zone ![](/assets/germantaxzone.png)create category for VAT, also make default

Create two new tax rates for general and reduced German VAT rates as per http://www.gtai.de/GTAI/Navigation/EN/Invest/Investment-guide/The-tax-system/value-added-tax-vat.html

Select 'include in price' - annoying for people not to see tax included prices when they are shopping
